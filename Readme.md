Physical setup:
	1. Circular room
	2. Annulus room

Class A (Physical motion):
	1. Random walk
	2. Following a marker along
		straight lines
	3. Follows marker along straight
		lines until switches direction,
		then random walk until
		probabilistic context switch happens

Class B (Waveform output):
	1.
